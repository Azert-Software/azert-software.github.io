      <title>AppSec Europe 2017 Comes To Belfast</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.azert.co.uk/uploads/2017/01/29/A1_belfast_2017_2.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year my home city Belfast will be hosting &lt;a href=&#34;https://2017.appsec.eu/&#34;&gt;AppSec Europe&lt;/a&gt;, one of, if not the biggest web security conference in Europe. This is setup by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page&#34;&gt;OWasp&lt;/a&gt; and the local chapter leaders have been exceptionally busy getting everything organised for this years show, in fact, they were already planning it at last years conference in Rome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a great week long conference featuring three days of instructor lead training (which I highly recommend) as well as two days of talks. These talks are from industry leaders in web security research, and if your company has so much as web connection you are at risk from a massive list of ever growing vulnerabilities and hacks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, every technology company in Belfast should be sending staff members to this. I went last year and attended a day of instructor lead training on securing Javascript web based applications which was very informative as well as attended the two days of talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a sneak peak of what you could be seeing, please come to the next &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Belfast/events/236972292/&#34;&gt;OWasp chapter meetup in Belfast&lt;/a&gt;, these are free events held every few months with free pizza and drinks. The next talk will be about Pen testing poorly implemented https, the impacts of not using https &amp;amp; Security Systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, you can view the videos of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrTShcOW8kM&amp;amp;list=PLpr-xdpM8wG-Kf1_BOnT2LFZU8_SXfpKL&#34;&gt;AppSec Europe 2016 on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Adding SSL to HMail with SSL For Free</title>
      <link>http://www.azert.co.uk/post/adding-ssl-to-hmail-with-ssl-for-free/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2017 13:05:31 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.azert.co.uk/post/adding-ssl-to-hmail-with-ssl-for-free/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-is-ssl-for-free&#34;&gt;What is SSL For Free?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&lt;span style=&#34;letter-spacing: 0.01em;&#34;&gt; run a private mail server on using a t1.micro Windows server on AWS using HMail as the mail server. This serves my @azert.co.uk emails and so far has proved to be extremely reliable, despite the small size of the server. I was running an m3.medium at one stage but it cost a fortune so that didn&amp;rsquo;t last very long!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the prerequisites for the mail server I had was SSL support, for obvious reasons of security, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to spend even more money on certificates. This is where &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sslforfree.com/&#34;&gt;SSL For Free&lt;/a&gt; comes in. SSL For Free is essentially a web interface over &lt;a href=&#34;https://letsencrypt.org/&#34;&gt;Lets Encrypt&lt;/a&gt; that simplifies creating SSL certificates somewhat. There is a bit of a catch though, while the certificates are free, you do need to renew them, currently this is every 90 days. When you setup an SSL For Free account they will email you in advance of the expiry, so you can take action, there are also programs available that will auto renew for you such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Lone-Coder/letsencrypt-win-simple&#34;&gt;LetsEncrypt Win Simple&lt;/a&gt;. Win Simple will also perform all certificate generation etc automatically, so if you can, I would advise using that, unfortunately I couldn&amp;rsquo;t use this as my www.azert.co.uk address points to this site and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to pollute the site with ACME validation pages (more on this later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;setting-up-ssl-for-free&#34;&gt;Setting Up SSL For Free&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly navigate to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sslforfree.com/&#34;&gt;SSL For Free&lt;/a&gt; and setup an account, this will then be used to email you for notifications of expiry &amp;amp; you can renew your existing certificates without having to repeat the below steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have an account, go to the homepage and enter the domain you wish to setup with SSL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.azert.co.uk/uploads/2017/01/29/Setup-Domain.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;validating-you-own-the-domain&#34;&gt;Validating You Own The Domain&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.azert.co.uk/uploads/2017/01/29/Validation-options.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you click &amp;lsquo;Create Free SSL Certificate&amp;rsquo; you will be taken to the above page. There are 3 options available, each with a description. If you are able to use LetsEncrypt Win Simple then just ignore these steps and use it, it&amp;rsquo;s by far the easiest option. For this guide I used the 3rd option as I couldn&amp;rsquo;t use the manual verification option on my server and had access to the dns through Route 53, provided by Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.azert.co.uk/uploads/2017/01/29/Manually%20verify.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have verified you own the domain carry on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;copying-to-your-mail-server&#34;&gt;Copying To Your Mail Server&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you have verified you will be taken to a screen with 3 text areas, each representing a different certificate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Certificate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Private Key&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CA Bundle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On your Mail Server you will need to create 2 files:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;private.key&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bundle.crt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can call them anything but this keeps their purpose clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In private.key copy the Private Key text area contents into the file and save.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the bundle.crt you will need to copy the entire contents of the text areas in order, to create a &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/what-is-ssl-certificate-chain/&#34;&gt;certificate chain&lt;/a&gt; without this chain of trust the LetsEcnrypt certificates will not validate. The order they should appear in bundle.crt is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Private Key&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Certificate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CA Bundle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final step is to setup hMail to use these certificate files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;hmail-ssl-setup&#34;&gt;hMail SSL Setup&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.azert.co.uk/uploads/2017/01/29/SSLSetup.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open hMail admin and go to Advanced -&amp;gt; SSL Certificates and create a new certificate giving it any name you wish. In the Certificate File field then select the bundle.crt file you created earlier. Then in the Private key file field select the private.key file you also created and click &lt;strong&gt;Save&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you will need to setup the Ports to reference the new Certificate you have created within hMail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.azert.co.uk/uploads/2017/01/29/PortSetup.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Staying in the Advanced section, open &lt;strong&gt;TCP/IP ports&lt;/strong&gt; and for each select SSL/TLS and choose the certifacte you have created. Click &lt;strong&gt;Save&lt;/strong&gt; for each one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THe final step is to test it, go to Utilities -&amp;gt; Diagnostics and ensure that connectivity can be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;troubleshooting&#34;&gt;Troubleshooting&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To test your setup and where you may have gone wrong the following are some useful tools:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mxtoolbox.com/&#34;&gt;MxLookup&lt;/a&gt; - used for testing your domain setup &amp;amp; forwarding etc is correct&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html&#34;&gt;SSLChecker&lt;/a&gt; - to validate your ssl certs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html&#34;&gt;OpenSSL WIndows&lt;/a&gt; - diagnostics tool I found useful when diagnosing why the SSLForFree certificate wasn&amp;rsquo;t validating (it needed the certificate chain)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;renewing&#34;&gt;Renewing&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you get the email advising you to renew, log into &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sslforfree.com/&#34;&gt;SSL For Free&lt;/a&gt;, you will then be taken to a page showing you existing certificates&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.azert.co.uk/uploads/2017/01/25/SSL-certs.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click renew and follow the steps taken earlier to validate your certificate, once re validated you won&amp;rsquo;t need to take any more steps, if you have let it expire, you will need to follow the steps again to create the certificate chain and copy to your mail server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#Finally&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you found this useful or have any further points to add or if I&amp;rsquo;ve missed anything, leave a comment below and I&amp;rsquo;ll get back to you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Azert delivers NiMicrolights website</title>
      <link>http://www.azert.co.uk/post/azert-delivers-nimicrolights-co-uk/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 23 Jan 2017 21:45:06 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.azert.co.uk/post/azert-delivers-nimicrolights-co-uk/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have created a new website for local microlight training school &lt;a href=&#34;www.nimicrolights.co.uk&#34;&gt;NiMicrolights.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A full write up of the project can be found over at the project page via the following &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.azert.co.uk/project/nimicrolights-website/&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; . This was a really enjoyable project for me, aircraft and flying being a real passion of mine. I managed this entire project in the evenings over about 5 nights!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is built using the same tech stack as this blog:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hugo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forestry.io&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This stack is such a breeze to use I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to use it in many more projects in the future. Do get in touch if there is a web project you&amp;rsquo;d like to discuss!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NiMicrolights Website</title>
      <link>http://www.azert.co.uk/project/nimicrolights-website/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 23 Jan 2017 13:49:26 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.azert.co.uk/project/nimicrolights-website/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.azert.co.uk/uploads/2017/01/23/Homepage.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;www.nimicrolights.co.uk&#34;&gt;www.nimicrolights.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have recently begun training towards achieving my NPPL microlight licence, flying has always been a real love of mine and between flying r/c planes and the odd trial lesson the desire to get a licence only grew! Well, I decided to go for it and the most affordable route for me was Microlights, plus, they give a really raw flying experience, it&amp;rsquo;s great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the school I am attending had a very old, 17 years I think, website, that was just really bothering me, so I decided to spend a week and build them something much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;technology-used&#34;&gt;Technology Used&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this I build the site using a static site generator &lt;a href=&#34;wwww.gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;. This allows you to build a theme, templates etc and rather than host a server &amp;amp; database, the generator builds your site once and outputs all html, css &amp;amp; js. This can then be hosted for free on &lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com/&#34;&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt;. As there is no server side processing to render pages, the site ends up being extremely fast and lightweight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site itself uses &lt;a href=&#34;http://getbootstrap.com/&#34;&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt; for it&amp;rsquo;s excellent responsive grid and to make future theming really easy, in fact, it&amp;rsquo;s so easy to theme, you can just open the CMSand paste a new link to a bootstrap theme to use, hey presto, new skin!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from that, a little of Javascript was used to power the live weather widget and that was it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CMS that the school will use to edit content is &lt;a href=&#34;https://forestry.io&#34;&gt;Forestry.io&lt;/a&gt;. This is designed specifically for static sites built using Hugo &amp;amp; GitHub pages. &lt;span style=&#34;letter-spacing: 0.01em;&#34;&gt;It also supports Jekyll and bit bucket. Now the school can login and make site edits, upload images etc whenever they wish, without having to get their old hosting provider to do it for them and charge for it to boot. (Azert is also built on the same stack).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-site&#34;&gt;The Site&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;homepage&#34;&gt;Homepage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The home page is shown at the top of this page, that is the main carousel and banner for the site. The user can easily change the images displayed here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;panels&#34;&gt;Panels&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.azert.co.uk/uploads/2017/01/23/Home-panels.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the homescreen these panels show key information a new or returning student may need with lesson booking front and centre. The live weather widget can be seen on the right, this pulls live weather from the nearest METAR weather station to the airport, very useful for students wanting to check on conditions before heading up. If conditions are not favourable it will display an alert advising them to contact the instructor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;testimonials&#34;&gt;Testimonials&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.azert.co.uk/uploads/2017/01/23/Testimonials.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing I thought missing from the original site was student feedback. Here the site user can add new testimonials from students using the sites CMS, just like they would any other content. This also helps prospective students to gain a bit of trust that the tuition they are getting is top notch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;news&#34;&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.azert.co.uk/uploads/2017/01/23/News.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old site was a pure static html site, no CMS was involved and therefor it was very hard to get content changed, one thing the school wanted was to be able to post when a student goes solo for the first time, or passes their exams. The news section allows them to do this, they can set a featured image as well as add whatever images, videos etc to the content page itself. It also allows users to share content, subscribe with an RSS reader as well as leave comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;gallery&#34;&gt;Gallery&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.azert.co.uk/uploads/2017/01/23/Gallery-1.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another new feature is the gallery, again, for a flying school, not having somewhere they could showcase pictures of the aircraft and student was sorely missed on the old site. This is fully responsive and works brilliantly on phones as well as the desktop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;mobiles&#34;&gt;Mobiles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.azert.co.uk/uploads/2017/01/23/Mobile.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, using bootstrap means the site works perfectly on mobiles, but see for yourself, visit &lt;a href=&#34;www.nimicrolights.co.uk&#34;&gt;NiMicrolights&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;old-site&#34;&gt;Old Site&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.azert.co.uk/uploads/2017/01/23/Old-site.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old site was very much &amp;lsquo;of its time&amp;rsquo; and just not fit for purpose, I&amp;rsquo;m sure you will agree the new site is a breath of fresh air and will hopefully encourage more students towards NiMicrolights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-work&#34;&gt;My Work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as the website I also helped setup the hosting provider to ensure A records and CNames were properly setup. i Also provided support to train the school up on the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like what you see and would like me to work on a site, just get in contact using the contact buttons on the left hand bar.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Welcome to Azert</title>
      <link>http://www.azert.co.uk/post/intro-to-azert/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 14 Jan 2017 21:00:31 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Azert is a new blog by Software Developer Mark Smith who lives in Northern Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I aim to post how to articles, articles solving problems I&amp;rsquo;ve came across and hopefully other bits of coding information people may find useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will also be using the site to showcase some personal projects I may publish to GitHub. This site is created with the simple aim of spreading knowledge, as well as to help me gleam knowledge from the wider internet. Certainly, if you come across some code, or solution I post and you think there is a better way, use the comment section to let me know. Constructive criticism is always welcome here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;about-me&#34;&gt;About me&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work at Intelligent Environments in the Product Team driving our platform forward to make the end user developer experience as seamless, joyful and fast as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this role I touch on many technologies, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GoLang&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C#&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NoSql (Couchbase)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Javascript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linux&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and many others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expect this blog to cover all of the above and more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also father to two girls, have been living with my partner for nearly 10 years and have too many hobbies, including the latest which is microlight flying!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-blog&#34;&gt;The blog&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a previous version of this written using &lt;a href=&#34;https://ghost.io&#34;&gt;Ghost.io&lt;/a&gt; early 2016, but I enjoyed the building of the site more than the thought of blogging so it sat dormat for many months. Around this time, I&amp;rsquo;d came across static sites but I had already the work done so thought I could revist. Well, fast forward to now and I&amp;rsquo;ve since lost half the code in the great hard drive wipe of 2016 and I&amp;rsquo;d not pushed the final code to GitHub (doh!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this in mind I decided to revisit the static site idea and came across a few different options before settling on &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;. This is an insanely fast, dependency free, static site generator built in GoLang and i&amp;rsquo;ve found it great to use so far so expect a tutorial in the near future!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would not consider this blog finished at this stage, but from an MVP stand point it&amp;rsquo;s good enough, so expect to see some improvements come as time passes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;# Contacting me&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can contact me through &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/azert-software&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://GitHub.com/azert-software&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; or leave a comment on this site of course.&lt;/p&gt;
