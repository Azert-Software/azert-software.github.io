      <description>This year my home city Belfast will be hosting AppSec Europe, one of, if not the biggest web security conference in Europe. This is setup by OWasp and the local chapter leaders have been exceptionally busy getting everything organised for this years show, in fact, they were already planning it at last years conference in Rome!
This is a great week long conference featuring three days of instructor lead training (which I highly recommend) as well as two days of talks.</description>
