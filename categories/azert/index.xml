      <description>I have created a new website for local microlight training school NiMicrolights.co.uk.
A full write up of the project can be found over at the project page via the following link . This was a really enjoyable project for me, aircraft and flying being a real passion of mine. I managed this entire project in the evenings over about 5 nights!
It is built using the same tech stack as this blog:</description>

      <description>Azert is a new blog by Software Developer Mark Smith who lives in Northern Ireland.
I aim to post how to articles, articles solving problems I&amp;rsquo;ve came across and hopefully other bits of coding information people may find useful.
I will also be using the site to showcase some personal projects I may publish to GitHub. This site is created with the simple aim of spreading knowledge, as well as to help me gleam knowledge from the wider internet.</description>
