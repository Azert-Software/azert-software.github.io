      <description>What is SSL For Free? Irun a private mail server on using a t1.micro Windows server on AWS using HMail as the mail server. This serves my @azert.co.uk emails and so far has proved to be extremely reliable, despite the small size of the server. I was running an m3.medium at one stage but it cost a fortune so that didn&amp;rsquo;t last very long!
One of the prerequisites for the mail server I had was SSL support, for obvious reasons of security, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to spend even more money on certificates.</description>
